    sattva: {
      problem: "Your gift of clarity can sometimes lead to getting lost in thought. You might have wonderful ideas but struggle to bring them into the real world, leading to a feeling of being stuck or unfulfilled.",
      solution: "The key is to ground your wisdom in action. Start by choosing one small, manageable idea and breaking it down into simple, practical steps. Taking that first step is your gateway to turning vision into reality."
    },
    rajas: {
      problem: "Your incredible drive is a superpower, but it can also lead to burnout. You might feel a constant need to be 'doing,' which can leave you feeling restless, scattered, and eventually exhausted.",
      solution: "The path to balance is learning to pause. Intentionally schedule short breaks for 'non-doing'—like a 10-minute walk without your phone. This isn't laziness; it's strategic rest that will make your actions more powerful."
    },
    tamas: {
      problem: "Your stability is a great strength, but it can sometimes turn into inertia or resistance to change. You might find yourself sticking to what's comfortable, even if it's no longer serving your growth.",
      solution: "Your path is to gently introduce new energy. Actively seek out inspiration—whether it's through uplifting music, a new hobby, or regular, gentle exercise. This helps move stagnant energy and invites fresh perspectives."

  SRT: { interplay: "Think of it like this: Sattva is your clear idea, Rajas is the energy to act on it, and Tamas is the steady hand that keeps you grounded. All three work together beautifully.", balance: "To stay in harmony, notice what you need. Feeling scattered? Rest and recharge your Tamas. Feeling stuck?

Remember that true balance is about flowing with life, not being rigid." },

You may have wonderful ideas but fail to share them because you're too comfortable with how things are. Dare to act on your wisdom." },
  TR: { interplay: "You are a master builder. Your endurance (Tamas) is fueled by a powerful engine of energy (Rajas).
