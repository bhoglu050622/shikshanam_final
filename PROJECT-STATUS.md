## 🎨 **Design & Theming**

All newly designed pages and features are required to maintain the same visual theme and design language as the homepage. This includes:
- Consistent use of color palette, typography, and spacing.
- Reuse of shared UI components (cards, buttons, badges, tabs, etc.).
- Responsive layouts using Tailwind CSS and Radix UI primitives.
- Animation and interaction patterns (Framer Motion) should match the homepage experience.
- Accessibility and dark mode support must be preserved.

**Note:** When designing new pages (e.g., quiz system, certificates, analytics), always reference the homepage for style and structure to ensure a unified user experience across the platform.
