## Issues Found and Resolved

### Critical Issues Fixed

#### 1. CMS Login Credentials Mismatch ✅ FIXED
- **Issue**: README documented credentials as `shikshanam/amanaman` but actual credentials were `shikshanam/admin123`
- **Impact**: Users could not access CMS with documented credentials
- **Resolution**: Updated README.md with correct credentials
- **Files Modified**: `CMS-README.md`

#### 2. Missing Lessons API Endpoints ✅ FIXED
- **Issue**: No API endpoints for lesson management (`/api/cms/lessons`)
- **Impact**: Cannot create, read, update, or delete lessons via API
- **Resolution**: Created complete lessons API with full CRUD operations
- **Files Created**: 
  - `app/api/cms/lessons/route.ts`
  - `app/api/cms/lessons/[id]/route.ts`
- **Files Modified**: 
  - `cms/lib/core/services.ts` (added `getAll` method to LessonService)
  - `cms/lib/core/cache.ts` (added lesson cache methods)

#### 3. Publishing API Database Field Mismatch ✅ FIXED
- **Issue**: Publishing API tried to set non-existent `publishedAt` field on Course model
- **Impact**: Publishing failed with internal server error
- **Resolution**: Updated publishing API to only set existing database fields
- **Files Modified**: `app/api/cms/publishing/[id]/publish/route.ts`
